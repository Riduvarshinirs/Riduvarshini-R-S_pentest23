# TOTP_3n1gm4
- Clicking on start instance i obtained a challenge instance and on clicking open deployment, it asked for 6 digit OTP
- i clicked on inspect and checked the cookies
- i googled about totp and found a link on totp which asked a secret key
- i decoded the cookie value using base64 and entered as secret key
- then i entered the totp which gave me the flag
- Flag=p3nt35t{T1m3_Tr4v3l3r_T0k3n}

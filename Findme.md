# Find Me
- i started with reading about what is apk , corellum
- i installed apk app in android phone
- apk app asked for username and password
- in desc i found hidden strings as clue
- using git clone https://github.com/skylot/jadx.git i installed jadx
- using cd jadx i changed directory to jadx
- i used ls to list all the files and directory under a specific directory
- using jadx-gui command i opened chall.apk in it
- out of all the files i found username and password in strinng.xml
- strings.xml is a collection of string used in android project
- the username and password was encrypted, then I searched about what kind of encoding is it . As it has '=' which means its a base64 decoding
- So I used base64 as key  to decode it.
- username=```android```
- password= ```pentest```
- I entered the username and password in android app and got the flag
- flag- p3nt35t{y0u_f0uNd_$tr!ng5.xml_f!13}
